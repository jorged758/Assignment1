							<span>I recently started my courses for this fall semester, including one of the most exciting and interesting course to learn which is Web and Script Programming. As part of it, I am creating a Portfolio about myself that also include some projects Iâ€™ve worked in. Some of these projects are:</span>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span>Developed a Sudoku and boggle solver using vision systems and machine learning with OpenCV and TensorFlow (140 hours)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Gained an understanding of data structures, various sorting algorithms, multi-threading/processing, low level memory manipulation, and machine learning algorithms in several Computer Science classes.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Learned how to code in Batch and Powershell during slow phone traffic at a Local Corporation which led to a new position in Automation Scripting, allowing the company to save hundreds of man-hours.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Developed a free C# toolkit to automatically root, unlock, lock, flash firmware, and perform various other modifications to a Xiaomi Mi A2 android phone including modification of operational wireless bands and kernel modification. (80 hours)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Created RaspberryPi system to play and record midi files on a Disklavier piano including: Google home integration, phone controls, touchscreen interface at the piano and web controls. (160 hours)</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span>Created automation scripts and code while working as an IT Technician at OTU IT Services streamlining new system installs, resulting in a time saving of several man-hours per system.</span>
								</li>
